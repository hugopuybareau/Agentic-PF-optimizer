            "portfolioAnalysis": "Based on your portfolio composition, I notice you have a heavy allocation in tech stocks (45%). While this has driven strong returns this year (+23%), consider diversifying into other sectors like healthcare or consumer goods to reduce concentration risk. Your current Sharpe ratio of 1.8 is excellent, but we could optimize it further.",
            "cryptoVolatility": "I see you're holding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Crypto markets are experiencing high volatility due to regulatory uncertainty and macro factors. Consider reducing your crypto allocation from 15% to 8-10% of your total portfolio to manage risk while maintaining upside exposure.",
            "marketTrends": "Current market conditions show mixed signals. The Fed's hawkish stance is pressuring growth stocks, but value stocks in financials and energy are outperforming. I recommend rebalancing 10% from growth to value stocks in the near term.",
            "riskAssessment": "Your portfolio's beta of 1.2 indicates higher volatility than the market. Recent additions of small-cap stocks increased your risk profile. Consider adding some defensive positions in utilities or REITs to lower overall portfolio beta to ~1.0.",
            "optimization": "I've identified several optimization opportunities: 1) Reduce overlap between your large-cap funds, 2) Add international exposure (currently 5%, recommend 15-20%), and 3) Consider tax-loss harvesting on your underperforming positions."
